            <h2>The story</h2>

                <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening,
                all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to 
                hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in 
                the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn 
                of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> </p>
                
                <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
                he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q>
                and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around 
                to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken 
                leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> </p>
                
                <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s 
                really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">Good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because 
                you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what
                will be the consequences of <strong class="good">Good</strong> fortune.</p>
